There is no specific file content for the my-ml-project/data/interim folder. It is simply a directory meant for storing intermediate data that has been transformed or processed in some way, but is not yet ready for use in the final model. The actual file contents within this folder will depend on the specific data being used and the preprocessing steps being taken.
