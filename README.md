# My ML Project

This project is for scientific purposes and contains the following directory structure:

- `data/raw`: contains the raw data files.
- `data/processed`: contains the processed data files.
- `data/interim`: contains the interim data files.
- `models/model1`, `models/model2`, `models/model3`: contains the trained models.
- `src/data_preprocessing.py`: contains the code for data preprocessing.
- `src/model_training.py`: contains the code for model training.
- `src/model_evaluation.py`: contains the code for model evaluation.
- `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`: contains the Jupyter notebook for data exploration.
- `notebooks/model_training.ipynb`: contains the Jupyter notebook for model training.
- `notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb`: contains the Jupyter notebook for model evaluation.
- `jobs/job1`, `jobs/job2`, `jobs/job3`: contains the job files.
- `.vscode/settings.json`: contains the settings for Visual Studio Code.
- `.vscode/launch.json`: contains the launch configurations for Visual Studio Code.

To get started, run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. The code for data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation can be found in the `src` directory. The trained models can be found in the `models` directory.
